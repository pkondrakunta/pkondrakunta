- 👋 Hi, I’m @pkondrakunta
- 👀 I’m exploring my interests in software development and Internet of Things domains
- ✨ I have worked in drone startups before and I am working at Lake Homes Realty on their backend team (MariaDB).
- 🔭 Now I am looking for software and devops roles in the drone, IoT and startup space.
- ▶️ Here's my [portfolio](https://pkon-portfolio.web.app/) (not optimized for mobiles/tablets yet🥲)
