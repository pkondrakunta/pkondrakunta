- 👋 Hi, I’m @pkondrakunta
- 👀 I’m exploring my interests in software development and Internet of Things domains

- 🔭 Now I am looking for software roles in the IoT and startup space.
- 🌱 Currently, I am learning the MVC Architecture using Spring, Tomcat and Hibernate.
- ▶️ Here's my [portfolio](https://pkon-portfolio.web.app/) (not optimized for mobiles/tablets yet🥲)
